## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Daily Workflow**
```
Morning:
- Check "Today" for must-dos
- Work through the list

Evening:
- Move completed tasks (they auto-move)

- Check "Upcoming" for tomorrow
```

### 2. **Weekly Review**
```
Friday/Sunday:
- Look at "Completed" - celebrate wins!
- Check "Upcoming" - plan next week
- Clean out "Inbox" - categorize everything
```

### 3. **Task Organization**

- **Due today?** → Shows in Today
- **Due next week?** → Shows in Upcoming
- **Work task?** → Also shows in Work Tasks
- **Finished?** → Shows in Completed

## 🔍 Example Task Flow

Let's say you create a task: "Finish project report"

1. **Created** → Appears in **Inbox**
2. **Add due date "today"** → Moves to **Today**
3. **Add category "Work Tasks"** → Also appears in **Work Tasks**
4. **Mark complete** → Disappears from all active views, appears in **Completed**

The same task can appear in multiple places:
- In "Today" (because it's due today)
- In "Work Tasks" (because it's work-related)
- In "Completed" (once you finish it)
