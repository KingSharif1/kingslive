# Do you know what an MCP is?

If you asked me this question a few months ago, I wouldn't have known where to start. But honestly, using them has completely changed my workflow.

So, let me take you back a bit.

## The "Work Smart" Mindset

I've always been one of those developers who prefers working smart over working hard (some might call it **lazy**). When **Windsurf** and other AI coding agents came out, I was excited to use them. I mean, having an assistant to help with the heavy lifting? That sounded great.

But at first, it wasn't perfect.

I kept running into issues where the AI just didn't have enough context. I'd be working on a project connected to a database, and the AI would struggle because it couldn't "see" what I was working with.

I'd ask it to write a query, and it would guess column names or make up tables. It was frustrating because I'd have to spend more time explaining the database structure than it would take to just write the code myself. The AI was helpful, but it was missing that crucial connection to my actual data.

## How I Found the Solution

One day, I was just scrolling through Twitter, and I found a thread talking about **MCPs** (Model Context Protocols). The author mentioned how it allows AI agents to actually connect to your database and understand your specific environment.

It sounded exactly like what I needed, so I decided to give it a try.

## Why It Made a Difference

Giving it a shot was honestly one of the best decisions I've made recently.

Suddenly, the AI wasn't just guessing anymore. It knew what my database looked like. It knew the inputs and the outputs. It had context.

It’s the difference between the AI guessing a table name versus it actually reading your schema and giving you the correct query instantly.

## So, What is an MCP?

Basically, an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** connects your AI model to your external tools and data.

Before this, the AI was kind of isolated. It knew code, but it didn't know *your* code or *your* database. MCPs bridge that gap. It allows the agent to check your actual database structure or file system before it answers.

There are plugins for different tools now, like Postgres or GitHub, which just gives the AI way more context to work with.

## Should You Use Them?

They might not completely change your life, but they definitely make the development process smoother. If you want your AI tools to actually understand what they're working on, then yeah, I'd recommend using them.

It just makes the AI better at its job, which makes you faster at yours.

Have you tried using any MCPs yet? Let me know what you think about them.

> **Note:** If you're trying this out, I definitely recommend starting with the database plugins. It’s pretty cool seeing the AI understand your data structure right away.
