# Why I Rebuilt My Portfolio (And How)

So, I was looking at my old portfolio the other day—you know how we developers do. We stare at code we wrote six months ago and think, *"Man, this needs an update."*

My old site ([www.kingsharif.com](https://www.kingsharif.com)) was... a vibe. It was colorful, interactive, and had this really cool minimalist shell floating around in the background powered by **Three.js**. It was flashy. It had a lot of moving parts. And honestly? It was pretty cool.

But this time, I wanted something different. I wanted something **slick**. Something **minimal**. Something that feels premium and "grown-up."

### The New Look: Slick & Minimal
For this 2025 refresh, I completely stripped back the noise. No more floating 3D objects (well, maybe just a little particle dust). The focus is entirely on typography and spacing.

I'm using **Fraunces** for the headers—it has this beautiful, editorial feel that just screams "class." For the body text, I went with **Open Sans** to keep everything super readable. The combination feels modern but timeless.

### The Chronicle: My Thought Stream
I didn't just want a portfolio; I wanted a home for my thoughts. So I built **The Chronicle**.

It's not about being some high-end publisher. It's really just a place where I can share what's going on in my head. I want to talk about the exciting new tech coming out, the problems I'm running into, and how I'm solving them. It's about showing my process—the messy, real stuff that we all deal with as developers—and just maneuvering through the challenges of building cool things.

### The Control Room
This is my favorite "hidden" feature. I added a **Control Room**—basically a private headquarters where I can manage everything. It's like my own little mission control center where I can do my own little stuff, manage content, and see what's happening under the hood. It makes maintaining the site feel less like a chore and more like piloting a spaceship.

### The Tech Stack
Of course, under all this slick UI, the engine is still powerful.

*   **Next.js 14 (App Router):** For that sweet, sweet server-side rendering and speed.
*   **TypeScript:** Because I value my sanity.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For styling without the headache.
*   **Sanity.io:** The CMS powering The Chronicle. It's incredibly flexible.
*   **Supabase:** Handling the backend magic for views and likes.
*   **Framer Motion:** Adding those subtle smooth animations that make the site feel "alive."

### Performance First
Even with all the new features, I made sure not to bloat the site. The old site was cool, but 3D libraries can be heavy. This new version flies.

It's been a fun build. It's simpler, cleaner, and honestly, it just feels more *me* right now. Check it out and let me know what you think!

## Focusing on Performance

One thing I really focused on was performance. I didn't want a site that looked cool but took 5 seconds to load.

I spent time cleaning up my dependencies, removing heavy libraries I wasn't using, and making sure my images were optimized. It's the little details like that—making sure the scroll experience is smooth and the layout doesn't shift—that make a project feel professional.

## What's Next?

This portfolio is definitely a work in progress. I'm planning to add more features, maybe some interactive demos or more "playground" elements. But for now, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

It's a representation of where I am right now as a developer—always learning, always building, and trying to work smarter, not just harder.
